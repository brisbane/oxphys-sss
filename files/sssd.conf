#2x auth.  You can log in with oxfrod credentials, but:
#1) secondary groups dont match
#2) Any file servers need to be configured to know about you
#3) If you do it in this order, you will appear as your 'physics' user name whichever account you use to log on
#4) If you invert the order, you will appear as oxford account whatever you use
#5) Groups will be determined from the user name you use to log on rather than the mapped name, sorry
